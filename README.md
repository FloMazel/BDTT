# Beta-diversity through time (BDTT) 

This repository contains R codes that can be used to run BDTT on a community ecology dataset. BDTT decomposes community dissimilarities by time-slicing the phylogenetic tree of all members (e.g. 16S rDNA reads) present in all communities. It allows the user to detect at which time or phylogenetic scale an environmental factor of interest shapes the most community compositions. It has recently been applied to analyse the composition of mammalian communites around the world and the composition of gut bacterial communities within mammalian guts

It has been written by myself with inputs from M. Groussin and J. Roy. 

In this repository, we provide a file that contains functions needed to run BDTT ('BDTT_functions.R') and example below.
